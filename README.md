## ABOUT

This project was realized during the real world assignment in [Codaisseur Traineeship](https://www.codaisseur.com).
This product is a check-in system for visitors. It allows the company to manage and register all the visitors in their building.
In the following sessions we are gonna describe the features that you can use with this tool.

## VISITOR REGISTRATION PAGE

In this page, the users that have never been in the building before, can register as visitors.
When the registration is submitted, the system automatically creates and confirm a booking for that user.
Users errors are taken into account by using validations for each field.

## ALREADY EXISTING VISITORS

In this page, the user that has already register, can find himself in with a responsive search field.
You can confirm your identity and your visit by clicking on your name.
Also, if the visitor doesn't have a booking, it will be automatically created and confirmed.

## DASHBOARD

This is where the backend of or project starts. We used different technology to add levels of security to the website.
The Dashboard is visible only by the admins and certain features are only available to super admin.
When an employees has been granted admin access, he/she can see all the visitors, download an Excel sheet and analyze the relative analytics.

*the graphs can display a daily, monthly and yearly overview of visitors*

Another feature for the admin is the possibility to create new bookings, in advance, for visitors.

The last but not least feature that we want to talk about is the automatic confirmation email that is sent when a booking has been confirmed. It will be sent to the admin that created that specific booking in the moment when the visitor checks in.
